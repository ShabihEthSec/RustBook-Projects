Rust is fast and fearless.  
rust builds the future.  
Code in silence, think in loops.  
The night is quiet, the bugs sleep.  
Trust the process, trust the code.  
Learn Rust, earn trust.  
Dream in logic, wake in light.  
Fearless minds build Rust again.In lines of logic, dreams unfold,
Rust and reason, brave and bold.
The keys hum songs the night can’t hear,
Of minds that wander, yet stay near.

Each bug a riddle, each fix a flame,
A spark reborn, never the same.
Through silence deep, the code will creep,
And whisper truths we’re meant to keep.
